# Text-Editor

## Description
In this assignment, I have created a Text Editor which the user can use to create code and edit it. The application can be run offline while also being able to be installed onto your computer as a seperate window.

## Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. Node.js
3. Web-Packs
4. Heroku
5. Visual Studio Code

## Challenges Faced
Since I find Webpacks quite a hard subject, I did struggle a lot with coding everything together. I do find it very confusing how to run the Webpacks, Service Workers and the dist folders to create this application. I do hope in future I will be swiftly confident with this. I also had many problems deploying onto as heroku cannot identify the path even though it is stated in the server.js. Heroku is also a subject I struggle with and hope to get confident with soon.
